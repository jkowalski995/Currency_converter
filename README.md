# Currency_converter

This is the simple currency converter made by using the PySimpleGUI.

I made this as my own one-day coding challenge. 

It's not perfect and many features can be added in the future but this is a 
task for another one-day challenge.

## This repository consits of 3 files:
- `gui.py` witch is the main app witch generate the GUI and ask user for providing the data
- `convert.py` this is a file containing the functions calculating the conversion of the currencies
- `connect.py` here this file connects with Polish National Bank (NBP) API and `GET` the currency values
